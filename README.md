# K8S NFS-Client Provisioner

nfs-client-provisioner, as presented by kubernetes-incubator, is an automatic provisioner that use your existing and already configured NFS server to support dynamic provisioning of Kubernetes Persistent Volumes via Persistent Volume Claims. 

The original version of this tool provisions persistent volumes dynamically with the following name:

``${namespace}-${pvcName}-${pvName}``. 

## Available functionalities

The nfs-client-provisioner is a go binary that offers two functions:
- Create: The function creates the PV with the proprer spec, and the data directory named as follow:`${namespace}-${pvcName}-${pvName}``.
- Delete: If reclaim policy is `Delete`, then this function will be called to delete the PV along side with the mounted volume. If `archiveOnDelete` is set to `true`, the data directory will be renamed as follow: ``archived-${original_name}``.

## What are the limits ?

When moving on with the tests of different use cases using this provisioner, we had the following problems:

- The created data directory is not located exactly where we want it to be. It is always created under another directory named ``${namespace}-${pvcName}-${pvName}``.
- For production measures, we don't use Delete or Recycle reclaim policies, but we would like the PV to be deleted when PVC is no longer needed.
- For the same measures, we like to keep our data directory even after deleting the PV and PVC.

### Side effects of these issues

I will give two different use cases to show you the purpose of this work:

#### First Usecase: Data directory

- Deploy an application that uses a PVC called pvc-nfs.
- Specify the target mounted directory on NFS share, by using ``subPath`` attribute under your containers spec.
- Create The PVC pvc-nfs that uses a storage class pointing to our nfs-client-provisioner.
- A new PV is dynamically created and will connect to the nfs provisioner to add the data directory.
- Data directory is created, but under the name ``${namespace}-${pvcName}-${pvName}``. This name has, in part of it, the PV name (autogenerated).
- Delete and recreate the PV PVC. 

Results:
- The new PV will create a new data directory having its name on it (in a part of it).
- The connection to the old data directory will be lost.

#### Second Usecase: Delete PVC doesn't delete PV automatically

** Using Retain claim policy
- Deploy an application that uses a PVC called pvc-nfs.
- Create The PVC pvc-nfs that uses a storage class with Retain policy pointing to our nfs-client-provisioner.
- A new PV is dynamically created.
- PVC is destroyed.
- PV changes status to Released, and the only way to make it available is by updating it manually [reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes)

** Using Delete or Recycle policy
- PVC destroyed.
- PV deleted and the data directory along side with it.

Observations:
- By using Retain policy, the PV is Released but not useful, and the disk space is not recycled.
- By using Delete and Recycle policies, the PV is destroyed and the data directory is lost.
- In the Delete policy, the ``archiveOnDelete`` option archives the data directory, but this could be difficult to handle in a high availability contexts.

## How to fix them ?

- Make sure the mounted directory has the same name value set in the subPath field on your application deployment spec.
- Make sure that, when PVC is deleted, PV is deleted as well, but the mounted data directory is still available for later use.
